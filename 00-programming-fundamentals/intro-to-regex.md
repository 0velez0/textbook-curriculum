# Introduction to Regular Expressions
## Learning Goals
Be able to answer the following questions:  
- What is a regular expression?
- How can I write a regular expression to match on a specific pattern?


## Introduction  

Regular expressions are a great tool for working with text. Using regular expressions (AKA Regex) you can identify and process patterns of text. Many people find regular expressions difficult to understand and use, but they can make a variety of tasks much easier, like validating that a phone number is in the right format.

You will likely only use a limited number of expressions during your time at Ada, but understanding Regex can simplify your code, and Regex is useful across multiple languages.
