# How to OS X: An Ode to Keyboard Shortcuts

The mouse is slow, especially on a laptop. There are *tons* of hotkeys, tricks, and techniques, to make your usage fast and efficient entirely from the keyboard. You will certainly learn many of these during your career, we'll start by learning just a few.  

## Learning Goals
By the end of this you should:
*  Be able to explain the important modifier keys such as control, shift, command, option on the OSX keyboard.
*  Be able to recognize the menu shortcuts.
*  Use the keyboard alone to close windows, quit applications, switch applications and switch tabs within a browser.
*  Be able to page up & down, jump the cursor to the beginning and end of a line of text, cut, paste, copy, delete, undo, redo, find & replace using keyboard shortcuts.  
*  Remember that you **can** create your own keyboard shortcuts.  
*  Have this page bookmarked for reference :)

## Learning the Menu Symbols


Whenever you open a menu, it will use these symbols to show you which keyboard shortcuts you can use to run the menu option at hand. It can be quite helpful to make a set of flashcards to remember these. I thought they were really _weird_ at first, and flashcards were a quick and easy method for me to test whether I'd learned the symbols correctly. 

Button | Mac Symbol | How I Remember It
-------|:----------:|------------------
Command | ⌘ | Ah, here's where I left those four robots I can command to open menus / do other computer stuff for me.
Option | ⌥ | Sliding down a bookcase lined with options & picking the first one that looks good.
Control | ⌃ | The magic button I need to press to gain control of a robot.
Shift | ⇧ | Hey, you short lowercase letter, come up here!
Caps Lock | ⇪ | And stay up! Here's a box to help. You can stand on it. :)

### A Word About Mice ###

Steve Jobs had a weird thing about single-button mice.  Trust me, it's bizarre.  Over time Apple's added 2-button mouse functionality to MacOS.  You can make a right click on your laptop by either by clicking and holding the option key down, or pressing with two fingers on the trackpad.  Or... you can just plug in a regular PC mouse and it'll work fine.

### Using a Windows Keyboard & Mouse ###


If you do use an external windows keyboard & mouse at home you'll find a few differences.  Most notably the mac will consider the "windows" key the command key.

### Windows External Keyboard
Windows Key | Mac Key 
--------|:----------
Control | Control!
Windows | Command
Alt     | Alt/Option
Escape  | Cancels out of active window / element or cancels next character
Insert  | Opens the *help* dialog
Delete  | Delete :p
Page up & Page Down | Moves the window up or down but does **not** move the cursor. 
Home/End | Jumps to the bottom of the document but does **not** move the cursor. 
Windows + Home/End | Jumps **with** cursor to top/bottom of document
Numlock | Nothing, nada
10-key-pad | Also nothing

### Taking Screenshots

Screenshots on a Mac are very cool. By default, they save a file to the desktop. If you add Control (⌃) to the shortcut, the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard instead.


Behavior / PC Key | Mac Keyboard Shortcut | In Symbols!
------------------|-----------------------|------------
Print Screen (full screen, saved to desktop) | Command + Shift + 3 | ⌘⇧3 (⌘#)
Print Screen (full screen, copied to clipboard) | Control + Command + Shift + 3 | ⌃⌘⇧3 (⌃⌘#)
Print Screen (select area, saved to desktop) | Command + Shift + 4 | ⌘⇧4 (⌘$)
Print Screen (select area, copied to clipboard) | Control + Command + Shift + 4 | ⌃⌘⇧4 (⌃⌘$)
Print Screen (application window, PC: Alt + Print Screen) | Command + Shift + 4, Space-bar, Click on Window | ⌘⇧4 (⌘$), {Space}, Click on Window

### Creating Your Own Keyboard Shortcuts


There might be applications that will do some or all of this for you, but I opted to make the changes manually. Some function keys were easier to reprogram than others. You'll need to open __System Preferences__ and go into __Keyboard__ settings. In the __Shortcuts__ tab, check out your options in the list on the lift. It should say things like __Launchpad & Dock__, __Mission Control__, and __Keyboard__. Click on __App Shortcuts__ at the bottom. Now you can customize your own shortcuts!

To create a shortcut, click the __+__ below the right options list. You'll see right away that you can choose between creating a shortcut for all applications or just for individual ones. The next thing you'll see is a field that asks for the __Menu Title__. To create a shortcut, all you have to do is find the menu option and type _exactly_ what it says into this field. Finally, click or tab over to the __Keyboard Shortcut__ field, and press the shortcut you'd like this functionality to be associated with. Hit the __Add__ button, and you're finished. It should work now. Try out your new keyboard shortcut and make sure it works right!

Unfortunately, not all applications use the same menu options for the same functions, so sometimes you may have to create multiple shortcuts to add the functionality you are looking for. For example, to restore the _F11_ / _Full Screen_ functionality to my Macbook, I had to create four separate entries in the Shortcuts creator. For restore the _F1_ / _Help_ dialog functionality, I had to create a separate shortcut for every application. So keep this in mind! Some things are easier to create as shortcuts than others.
