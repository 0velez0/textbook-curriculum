# How to OS X: An Ode to Keyboard Shortcuts

The mouse is slow, especially on a laptop. There are *tons* of hotkeys, tricks, and techniques, to make your usage fast and efficient entirely from the keyboard. You will certainly learn many of these during your career, we'll start by learning just a few.  

## Learning Goals
By the end of this you should:
*  Be able to explain the important modifier keys such as control, shift, command, option on the OSX keyboard.
*  Be able to recognize the menu shortcuts.
*  Use the keyboard alone to close windows, quit applications, switch applications and switch tabs within a browser.
*  Be able to page up & down, jump the cursor to the beginning and end of a line of text, cut, paste, copy, delete, undo, redo, find & replace using keyboard shortcuts.  
*  Remember that you **can** create your own keyboard shortcuts.  
*  Have this page bookmarked for reference :)

> ### Learning the Menu Symbols ###
- - -

Whenever you open a menu, it will use these symbols to show you which keyboard shortcuts you can use to run the menu option at hand. It can be quite helpful to make a set of flashcards to remember these. I thought they were really _weird_ at first, and flashcards were a quick and easy method for me to test whether I'd learned the symbols correctly. 

Button | Mac Symbol | How I Remember It
-------|:----------:|------------------
Command | ⌘ | Ah, here's where I left those four robots I can command to open menus / do other computer stuff for me.
Option | ⌥ | Sliding down a bookcase lined with options & picking the first one that looks good.
Control | ⌃ | The magic button I need to press to gain control of a robot.
Shift | ⇧ | Hey, you short lowercase letter, come up here!
Caps Lock | ⇪ | And stay up! Here's a box to help. You can stand on it. :)

#### Text Editing Keyboard Combinations

Below are a series of keyboard shortcuts that will help you in a text-editor writing code.

Hot Key Combo | Mac Symbols | How I Remember It
--------|:----------:|------------------
Command-s  | `⌘s` | Save code in the text editor!  **Do this a lot!**
Command-c  | `⌘c` | Copy the text currently highlighted (ctrl-c in windows).
Command-x  | `⌘x` | Remove the text highlighted and save it in the clipboard.
Command-v  | `⌘v` | Paste last copied content from clipboard.  
Command-z  | `⌘z` | Undo the last action (repeat to undo multiple things). 
Command-shift-z | `⌘⇧z` | Redo the last undo.
Command-a  | `⌘a` | Select everything in the window.
Command-l  | `⌘l`| Select the current line.
Command-Arrow | `⌘<directional arrow>` | Move the cursor to the maximum point in the given direction.  
Option-left-or-right-arrow | `⌥<left or right arrow` | Move the cursor one word in either direction
Shift-Arrow | `⇧<cursor movement command>` | Highlight from the start and end of the cursor

#### System Navigation
Hot Key Combo | Mac Symbols | How I Remember It
--------|:----------:|------------------
Command-w | `⌘w`     | Close the Current tab.
Command-shift-w | `⌘⇧w`     | Close the Current window (all the tabs).
Command-q | `⌘q`     | Quit the application (`⌘⇧w` keeps the application running).


- `⌘q`: quit the current application
- `⌘⇥`: switch applications, continue to hold `⌘` to display all open programs, each tap on `⇥` will switch to the next app. Use ⇧⇥ to switch to previous app.
- `⌘ backtick`: (backtick is below `esc`), switch windows in the current application, use ⇧ backtick to switch to previous window.
- `⌘␣`: open Spotlight. Spotlight is a tool to search applications, files, and perform some basic function like math and conversions

### Common Application Hotkeys
- `⌘⇧[`: move one tab to the left
- `⌘⇧]`: move one tab to the right
- `⌘⇧t`: open the last closed item
- `⌘f`: find, opens a panel to type a search term
- `⌘⇧f`: find all, searches all files (text editors only, Atom, Sublime)
- `⌘n`: open a new window (or file depending on the application)
- `⌘t`: open a new tab (includes file search in text editors)
- `⌘r`: reload page (Browsers only)
- `⌘,`: open settings pane
- `⌘/`: make selection or line a comment (text editors only)

Hotkeys can be at the system level or specific to a certain application. Not all application will respond to these hotkeys, but the majority that we use (Terminal, major browsers, Atom, Sublime) will.

It takes some practice but after you use these enough, they will become intuitive. Many of the hotkeys I use, I couldn't tell you what they are, my hands just know how to do them.
Resources. Pick top 5 Hotkeys you'd like to use, and force yourself to use them.

Hotkeys can be added or changed under `Keyboard` in the OS X _System Preferences_.
