# Get to Know Your Friendly Text Editor

## Atom
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a powerful new text editor created by Github. It's build using node.js and other web technologies.  Atom is the text editor we will be using and supporting at Ada.

### There are lots of other editors.
And every person you ask will have a favorite with a very personal list of reasons why their choice is right. Take these with a grain of salt. Use what makes the most sense to you. It's likely you'll change editors every couple of years anyway.  The most important thing is that the editor works for you and meshes with your workflow.

## More About Atom

### Themes
Themes change the way your editor looks, similar to packages
enter the `Preference` and click on the `Themes` tab, browse, and install.

You can even customize themes using a language called CSS, which we'll be learning in a few weeks.

### Packages

One of the most powerful parts of Atom is the ability to install custom packages. These can add features as weird and varied as:

- Linters (spellchecker for code)
- A minimap of your code
- Autocomplete for common patterns
- A tool to let you pick colors

We'll add some of these as they become relevant. Feel free to look some up if they interest you, but for now just know that they exist.
