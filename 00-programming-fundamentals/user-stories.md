# User Stories

## Learning Goals
Students should be able to:
- Explain the concept of a user story.
- Write user stories to gather requirements.

## Overview

As developers, when we begin to develop software we start by gathering requirements.  These requirements are written by or for the customer to help developers put together the tasks needed to build the software.

A user story is a sentence identifying the type of user, the task and often the goal the task accomplishes.  

For example:  

- As an **Air BNB host** I want to **pull up a calendar listing all my reservations** so **I can plan my schedule**.  
- As an **Anynomous user on Expedia** I want to **search for flights by day**.  So **I can find a cheap flight**.

User stories are typically written on index cards or post-it notes and they help define what needs to be done in a project.  Sometimes they have acceptance tests attached to them.  

Once the initial round of stories is created they are prioritized and often put into a kanban board to be scheduled.  We will talk more about [kanban](http://kanbanblog.com/explained/) when we address [Agile](intro-to-agile.md).

A typical template for a user story could be:

-  As a _____________  I want to _____________  so ________________.

This template identifies the who, what and why of the story.



## Things to avoid in user stories
User stories should focus on the user experience and avoid...
-  Implementation details
-  Making a story too big and complex.  They should be small discrete tasks.  Break down tasks that are too big and complicated into smaller stories.
