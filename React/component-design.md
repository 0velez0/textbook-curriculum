# Component Design

## Learning Goals
- Examine design patterns used by React developers
- Use the functional stateless components design pattern
- Use the container components with presentational components pattern

## Functional Stateless Components
- No lifecycle methods, only rendering
- Can still utilize `props` but not `state`

## Container Components with Presentational Components
We can utilize container components which will manage the flow of data to presentational components. Oftentimes presentation components are the functional stateless components.
