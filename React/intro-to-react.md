# Introduction to React

## Learning Goals
- What is React?
- Why do we learn React?
- Who is using React?

## What is React?
ReactJS is an [open-source](https://github.com/facebook/react) JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It encompasses only the **V** in the MVC Pattern.

React is modular through the use of **components**. Each component manages it's own state and then components can be composed within one another to create a rich user experience.

## Why React?
There are a lot of reasons that technology teams are switching to use React. You can read one of those from the Netflix team written a few years ago on their transition in the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) below.

Here at Ada, we teach React because it equips our JavaScript developers with these skills:
- Designing an application to leverage the constructs and patterns of a library
- Using syntax that you've already seen (with HTML & CSS) in a slightly different way with JSX
- Design a modular application with individual pieces that fit together

## Who is using React?
React was originally developed by Facebook so they're the first one to mention. Also sites like Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram and Netflix use React. You can read even more companies in the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) below.

## Key Takeaway
React is extremely popular right now and is growing in popularity. The Virtual DOM makes React a desirable solution for web applications where performance and modular are in consideration.
