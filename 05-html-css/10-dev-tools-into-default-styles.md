## What are Developer Tools?

The Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short), are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application.

Other Browsers, such as Firefox and Safari, have their own debugging developer tools. They are worth becoming familiar with as you begin to be aware of cross-browser compatibility. Because we are only developing with Chrome this week, we are going to focus specifically on Chrome's Developer Tools.


## Dive into Developer Tools!
To open Developer Tools,
- either right click on a page and click on 'inspect' from the menu
- Use Ctrl+Shift+I (or Cmd+Opt+I on Mac) to open the DevTools.
