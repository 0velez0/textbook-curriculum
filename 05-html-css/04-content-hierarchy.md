# Content Hierarchy with HTML5


## Learning Goals ðŸ“š
- Can organize content using semantic HTML5 tags
- Know why we organize content with semantic HTML5 tags


## But why?
These allow you to organize your document content into logical topical sections.

They bring a big advantage for people having HTML5 browsers and needing the structure to help them understand the page, for instance people needing the help of some assistive technology.


## Sectioning Elements

```html
  <body> </body>

  <section> </section>

  <article> </article>

  <nav> </nav>

  <aside> </aside>

  <header> </header>

  <footer> </footer>
```
- Your document should only have one **<body>** tag, all content you want to be visible on a web page should be between the body tags.

- The **<section>** represents a group of related content.

## Organize content with Sectioning Elements
Sectioning elements wrap around the elements we have already been working with. This will not change anything visually.

## Vocab âœ…

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway

The new semantic elements introduced in HTML5 bring the ability to describe the structure and the outline of a web document in a standard way.
