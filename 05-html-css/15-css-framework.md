## What is a Front-end Framework?



By using Foundation's already made css code, we can more quickly setup a layout for our site by strategically adding classes to html elements.

## Grid Layout

```HTML

```


![]()

## Block Grid

```html

```


## Grid Nesting


## Further Customization
It is typical to use Sass when developing with Foundation. Using Sass allows you to customize easily by setting variables, yes variable in CSS! It's amazing!

But we're not there yet.

Instead you'll have to overwrite Foundations styles in the app.css. You can also set some customizations before downloading on [this page](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download.html/).



## Best Practices
- NEVER change any CSS in Foundation's documents
  - It's _okay_ to override them, if necessary, but do so in your own CSS documents.
- Comment your HTML & CSS by sections to stay organized
- Keep Validating your HTML Code!
