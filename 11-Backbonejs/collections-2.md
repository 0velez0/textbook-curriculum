# Advanced Collections: Adding, Sorting and Events

We haven't done much with collections yet - so far, they're basically just arrays that require a bunch of extra work. In this lesson we'll look at Backbone's event handling behavior, and use this to build two new types of functionality for our BackBooks app: adding and sorting.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe what a Backbone event is
- Register a callback function for an event
- List some of the events fired by collections, including `change` and `sort`
