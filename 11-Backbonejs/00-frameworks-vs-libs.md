# JavaScript: Frameworks vs. Libraries

So far we have used one JavaScript library, jQuery! Next up we are going to use another JavaScript library. Oftentimes during our conversations about JavaScript we talk about using a framework or a library. Generally speaking, the difference between a framework and a library is in how it interacts with your code.

A library, like jQuery or the Ruby CSV gem, is a toolbox, from which you select the function or class that you need. The library accomplishes specific tasks, but ultimately your code is what's in charge. Examples of JavaScript libraries include:
- jQuery
- Backbone
- Underscore

A framework, like Rails, is just the opposite. You write some code (like a controller action) which is called by the framework. The framework is in charge; it's running the show. The vocab word for this is _inversion of control_. Frameworks tend to be much more structured than libraries, and they impose that structure on your program (this is not necessarily a bad thing!). Example of JavaScript frameworks include:
- React
- Angular
- Ember

There are a lot of opinions about which is better, and oftentimes even opinions about whether there's really a meaningful difference between the two.

## Why One Over The Other?
To determine whether you want to use a library or a framework, you really need to this about the level of control you'd like to have over the application.
