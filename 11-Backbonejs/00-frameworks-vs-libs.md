# JavaScript: Frameworks vs. Libraries

So far we have used one JavaScript library, jQuery! Next up we are going to use another JavaScript library. Oftentimes during our conversations about JavaScript we talk about using a framework or a library. There are a lot of opinions about which is better, and oftentimes even the opinion about if there is a meaningful difference between the two.

Was Rails a Framework or a library? Framework! Let's see how our understanding of Rails falls under our new/refreshed understanding of Frameworks vs Libraries.

## Frameworks
A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries to help with building an application. A framework can decide upon and create structure.

Examples:
- React
- Angular

## Libraries
A library is a collection of functions and/or objects that serve one particular purpose. You can simplify things that you create, but generally we do not use libraries to influence overall structure.

Examples:
- jQuery
- Backbone

## Why One Over The Other?
To determine whether you want to use a library or a framework, you really need to this about the level of control you'd like to have over the application.
