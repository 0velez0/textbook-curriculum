# Arrays, Linked Lists
## Goal
+ Singly linked list, doubly linked lists
+ Design a singly linked list with object oriented principles
+ Singly linked list data structure & related algorithms (with time and space complexities)
+ Doubly linked list data structure & related algorithms (with time and space complexitites)
+ Algorithms:
  + Visit or print value at each node
  + Search for a node with a particular value
  + Find the node with min/max value
  + Sort the nodes in the linked list in ascending or descending order of values
  + Delete a node in the linked list
  + Add a node in the linked list
  + Remove the first 'k' nodes in the linked list
  + Find the nth node from the end of a linked list
  + Find the middle node in the linked list
  + Check for cycle in a singly linked list

## Required
Go through what you've already learned in the CS Fundamentals classroom curriculum:
+ [Linked List](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/classroom/LinkedList.md)

## Exercises
Design an algorithm, deduce the space and time complexity and then, author functions to do the following:
For each of the problems below: Assume you are given a singly linked list where each node in the linked list has integer data and a link to the next node.
  + Exercises coming soon

Do the same exercises for a doubly linked list where each node contains an integer data and two links: one to the previous node and one to the next node in the doubly linked list.
