## In Class
Here's the problems we'll cover in class.
Design and implement pseudo code for functions to do the following:
+ 1. Check if a singly linked list has a cycle. Return true if it has a cycle, false if it doesn't.
+ 2. Find the middle node in a singly linked list. Return a pointer or reference to it.
+ 3. Find the nth node from the end of a singly linked list, assuming index starting at 0. Return a pointer or reference to it.
+ 4. Insert a node into a singly linked list sorted in ascending order of data
+ 5. Remove the first 5 nodes from a singly linked list
+ 6. Empty a singly linked list
+ 7. Insert a node into a sorted singly linked list with value 999.
+ 8. Delete nodes in a singly linked list with specified data value e.g. int value of 5
+ 9. Print the largest integer data value in a singly linked list
+ 10. Print all integer data values in a singly linked list
+ 11. Reverse a singly linked list. (Test: if reference to the first node is recorded before the function call, it should be pointing at the last node in the singly linked list after the function call is complete.)
+ 12. Append a node to the beginning of a singly linked list
+ 13. Check if the singly linked list contains a given integer value.
</br>
<b>Note</b>: For all singly linked list questions, assume each node in the linked list to have integer data and link to the next node
+ 14. Implement a function to add a Node to the beginning of a doubly linked list.
+ 15. Implement a function to remove a Node from the beginning of a doubly linked list. 
+ 16. Implement a function to add a Node at the second position in a doubly linked list.
+ 17. Implement a function to remove the second Node from a doubly linked list.
