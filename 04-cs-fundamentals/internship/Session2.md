## Offline Problem Sets
+ In "Cracking the Coding Interview" book, "Chapter 4: Trees and Graphs"
+ CareerCup [Trees and Graph Interview Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=trees-and-graphs-interview-questions) - scan and look for the tree interview questions.
+ Kal academy's problems on [Trees](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHords9odw3b2d1ZTJtVkZZTkk)
+ Print all values in a Binary Tree using Post-order traversal using an iterative solution. Assume you are provided a Stack data structure that can contain the tree Node pointer or reference.
+ Given 2 Binary Trees (not BST), return true if both trees have the same in-order else return false. Note: You can save in-order from both trees and compare in the end (try implementing this as well). Can you inorder traverse them parallely and stop the traversal on a mismatch to return false instead?

## In Class
Time permitting, here's the problems we'll cover in class.
Design and implement pseudo code for:
+ 1. Delete a given value from a Binary Search Tree.
+ 2. Print all values in a Binary Tree using Pre-order and In-order traversals. Implement each solution iteratively. Assume you are provided a Stack data structure for 'struct Node*'
+ 3. Print all values in a Binary Tree using Pre-order, Post-order and In-order traversals. Implement each solution recursively.
+ 4. Find the height of Binary Tree. Implement the recursive solution.
+ 5. Insert a given value in a Binary Search Tree. Implement both iterative and recursive solutions.
+ 6. Find a given value in a Binary Search Tree. Implement both iterative and recursive solutions. </br>

<b>Note</b>: For all singly linked list questions, assume each node in the linked list to be: </br>
struct node { </br>
  &nbsp; int data; </br>
  &nbsp; struct node *next; </br>
}; </br>
