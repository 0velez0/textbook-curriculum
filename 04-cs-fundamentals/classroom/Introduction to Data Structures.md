# Introduction to Data Structures
## Learning Goals
+ Get familiar (at a high level) with different data structures:
  + Arrays
  + Linked Lists
  + Stacks
  + Queues
  + Graphs
  + Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Heaps)
  + Hash Table

## Notes
Please see the slide deck linked at the bottom
<!--
## Essential Reading
Here's some good follow up reading after we meet in class:
  + [Big O notation and complexity in Ruby](https://devblast.com/b/big-o-notation-complexity-ruby) by DevBlast
-->
## Exercises
Here's the exercises we'll cover in class.
1. Design and implement a method that will return true if the two input strings are anagrams of each other, and false otherwise. What is the time and space complexity of this method?
2. Understand how delete and insert algorithms work on a static data structure like an array

## Assignments
Complete the string manipulation practice questions on [Ada-C8/StringManipulationInterviewPractice](https://github.com/Ada-C8/StringManipulationInterviewPractice)
