__Resource is currently being built__ Reference this (document)[http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/cs1316/uploads/629/Spring_2008_Breaking_the_Problem_Down_Problem_Solving_in_OO_Computer_Science.1.pdf] that the lecture is being built around.

## Learning Goals
- Given a problem, can identify:
  - Entities
  - Attributes
  - Composition between entities
  - Inheritance between entities

## From Problem to Design

So far we have given you most of the technical specifications necessary for the projects you have been working on. Before giving you the project, us instructors met and planned the design of the applications you would make, before giving you the technical requirements. We did so to focus on

With all the knowledge you have, you now can start making these decisions



Take this problem:
You have been tasked with building an application that will keep track of sports games. For example

soccer games. A game needs to keep track of two teams, final scores, date of game, and what players scored each goal. Each team should consist of twenty players, have a team name and name of the head coach.

With this application, I want to be able to.


This application should have functionality to:
  - Find a game by date or team.
  - Find a team by coach or name.
  - Find all the teams a player has played for.

### Identify Nouns

Make a list of all the nouns. Which ones seem more appropriate to have as an entity, or a class, and which ones should be an attribute of an entity?

In order to make that decision, a good rule of thumb is to

### Identify Attributes

What data type or structure should it be.

### Identify any opportunities for Composition between Entities

What relationships are there between each entity?

Ask: what entity 'belongs to' another entity? If there is a belongs to 

### Identify if any Entities could utilize Inheritance
