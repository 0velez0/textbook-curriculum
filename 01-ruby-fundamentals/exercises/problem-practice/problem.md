# Math Problem Analyzer

This exercise will be good for you if you want more practice with:
- writing methods in a class
- calling methods on an instance of a class
- working within (some) code that is already written for you

In this exercise, we will use object-oriented principles to create a math problem analyzer. The goal is that your program will interact with 

## Optional
Add a `validate` method which will validate the user input to determine whether or it is valid before checking if it is the correct answer. Update the runner file to use the `validate` method and permit the user to continue trying until they provide a valid input.
