# OOD Exercise: Library Book

We are creating a program to keep track of a library's books.
A book should have a title, author, description, a call number, year published, and number of copies available to check-out.

The book should be able to be checked-out, book should be retired after being checked-out 100 times,


## Get Started
Create a new ruby file

Make a class for a library Book

Have your Book accept and set the appropriate attributes

Create the appropriate reader & writer methods for your class' attributes

Have you tested yet? By now you should have made tests that:
  - Can create new instances of your book class
  - Pass in the appropriate attributes when creating the class
  - Can call the appropriate attributes outside of the class
