#  Self-Care and Preservation

## Objectives:
1.) Respond to the request that our work address mental health, neuorodiversity, and well-being. Respond to the question, "What about when we leave Ada?" As individuals and as an Ada community, how do we sustain ourselves in other communities may not feel as intentional or social-justice oriented? Move away upper-middle class, consumerist notions of self-care and explore ideas for simple, grounding practices. Create a new definition of self-care together. Create goals for maintaining supportive, identity-based communities during and after Ada.

2.) Respond to feedback from the Inclusivity Workshop. Update students on what we've done and what we're doing. Hear students' feelings on this.
