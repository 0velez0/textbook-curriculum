#  Self-Care and Preservation

## Objectives:
1.) Respond to the request that our work touches on mental health, neuorodiversity, and well-being. Respond to the question, "What about when we leave Ada?" We will tap into Adies' wisdom to create a community coversation around how we sustain ourselves in communities that may not feel as safe, intentional, or social-justice oriented a Ada. Move away upper-middle class, consumerist notions of self-care and explore ideas for simple, grounding practices. Create goals for maintaining supportive, identity-based communities during and after Ada.
2.) Respond to feedback from the Inclusivity Workshop. Update students on what we've done and what we're doing. Hear students' feelings on this.
