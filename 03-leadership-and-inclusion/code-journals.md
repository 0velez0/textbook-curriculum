# Code Journals

## Purpose

The purpose of the Code Journal is to give each individual at least one tool for self-reflection. With the practice of consistently filling out the code journal, we hope to accomplish the following specific things:

- Teach and practice self-reflection
- Reinforce weekly learning goals
- Give you an artifact to catalog and review your learnings over time

**An Ada instructor will never ask to see your code journal.**

## How

The code journal is yours. Feel free to fill it out and use it however is most useful for you. Use markers and draw and bullet journal if that's what works best for you! Keep it clean and orderly if that's what you'd like, or scribble in it and draw pictures if you need to.

At Ada, we'll ask that each person is intentional about how they reflect, though. It may be useful to use the following template for your weekly entry. This template emphasizes reflecting on the learning goals.

### Where can I find the Learning Goals for the week?

You can find learning goals listed at the beginning of each lecture.

## Duration

During the classroom portion of Ada, we will schedule a small amount of time every week to work on your code journal. This time may be included with a weekly assessment, or during project time.

After the classroom portion of Ada, it is up to you how you would like to continue your code journaling!
